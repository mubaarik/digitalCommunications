The files labeled 1.dat, 2.dat, .., 6.dat are all encoded using a
maximum dictionary size of 2^16 to get their corresponding .zl files.

If you want to test your encoding with an alternative maximum
dictionary size, we have included 5.dat.512.zl and 6.dat.512.zl.
These are the result of encoding 5.dat and 6.dat with a maximum
dictionary size of 512.
